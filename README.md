## Particle modeling with DEM

☑️ Computational code for modeling spherical particles considering interparticle collision based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM).

☑️ The initial interest for the development of this code was to apply it in multiphase flows.

☑️ The code is setup with a case of two particles, one falling on top of the other.
