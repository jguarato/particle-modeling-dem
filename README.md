## Particles modeling with DEM

Computational code for modeling spherical particles considering interparticle collision based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM).

The initial interest for the development of this code was to apply it in multiphase flows.

The code is setup with a case of two particles, one falling on top of the other.

This code were developed during my undergraduate studies.
